					<p>
						In 2011 I moved to Minneapolis, enrolled at The Art Institute where
						I received my Bachelors degree of Science in Culinary Management.
					</p>
					<p>
						I took an entry position with a new hotel â€“ Firelake Restaurant at
						the Radisson Blu Mall of America. While at that position as a line
						cook and with my degree I not only learned the art of the food, the
						techniques, the creativity and genuine passion needed. I also
						learned that succeeding in that industry was much more. It also
						takes the ability to skillfully multitask while remaining organized
						to the highest of standards.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div className="snap-center bg-blue-500">
					<p>
						After five years at the Firelake restaurant I had worked my way up
						to Chef de Partie (supervisor). That lead me to take a position as a
						Sous chef at an owner ran restaurant that was also highly ranked in
						the cities, winning many awards: Revival Minneapolis.
					</p>
					<p>
						There I learned the stamina it takes to manage a smaller and
						exceedingly busy restaurant both physically and mentally. Though, I
						will say, I enjoyed those long days and nights. That feeling of
						accomplishment at the end of a successful day where you and your
						team made it to the other side of the chaos that we had endured in
						the previous hours.
					</p>

				<div className="snap-center bg-red-600">
					<p>
						In 2019 I went back to the corporate hotel side of the industry at
						the Hyatt Regency as the executive sous chef. There I gained the
						knowledge of the true leadership skills it takes to lead a team and
						to get the best out of every individual team member. As the
						executive sous chef I had mastered the art of time management as
						well as the resiliency needed to handle constructive criticism.
						Looking at it honestly and improving my skillsets.

						Which all leads to the pandemic and the uncertainty of restaurants.
						I was laid off when all the restaurants closed and my daughter was
						three months old. As I found myself unable to work in my industry
						for the first time in nearly a decade, I became a stay-at-home dad.
						I inevitably fell more in love with my daughter and I have loved
						every minute of it.
					</p>
					<p>
						As much as I loved being a chef, I looked at my future and decided I
						do not care to continue working most nights and nearly every
						holiday.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div className="snap-center bg bg-gray-500">
					<p>
						I was unsure about what my future entailed, when a friend introduced
						me into something called codecademy and a I truly enjoyed it. Soon
						after I enrolled in a 6 month long bootcamp, took multiple online
						courses and trainings and watched countless youtube videos. I
						constructed myself a path acquiring the skills and tools needed to
						become a programmer. After a somewhat long journey with many ups and
						some downs, I have acquired the skills and tools needed to feel
						confident in myself as a programmer.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div className="snap-center bg-purple-600">
					<p>
						Also knowing, as I gained an understanding for in culinary, to go
						into it with the willingness to continue learning and acquiring the
						never-ending sources of skills and knowledge.{' '}
